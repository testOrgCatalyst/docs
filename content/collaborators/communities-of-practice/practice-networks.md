# practice networks testing
prisma is a distributed incubator for communities of [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) and on-the-ground [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md) to self-organise [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md).

we're working closely with [Regenesis](/collaborators/communities-of-practice/Regenesis.md) [^1], who are evolving a practice of regenerative development and design. 

at the core of our [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) is the dynamic interplay between the forward movement of [enacting](/processes/enactment) (action) and the ongoing, reflective and integrative movement of [evaluating](/processes/evaluation) (learning). our work is to develop these methodologies and the infrastructures supporting organising such events. 

[action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) are a period of rapid innovation, guided by a facilitator team that has been co-designing with the [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md) for a number of months - each event requiring several months of intention development, co-design, alignment and systems onboarding.[^2]

> 
> *in a way that* enables practitioners working on-the-ground to communicate the essence of their work **themselves**

> *so that* the instrument used to communicate the application of practice can evolve **with** the community of practice and the evolving practice itself.

# Stakeholder Groups
event capacities are sourced from at least the following four stakeholder groups:

1. participants
2. [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md)
3. [practice networks](/collaborators/communities-of-practice/practice-networks.md)
4. partners

these [stakeholder development pathways](https://register.prisma.events) are being designed to form a 3-5 month onboarding process. 

the [process-infrastructuring](/processes/process-infrastructuring) developed to support the organisation of each event instance is also designed to be configurable and self-contained, able to be deployed to a server/ device network local to the [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md) hosting the event. the purpose of this is to align with the aim of building capacity in-place for ongoing development of the products incubated during the intensive.

[^3]: The creative tension of glocal: visibility and verification of local network effect at global-scale levels of capital distribution. mediating multiple forms of evaluation and communicating success cases of application of practice. global systemic crises (are [complex systems](complex systems) and) require vast amounts of thinking processing in order to respond collectively and regeneratively. evolving systems at those scales whilst at the same time in alignment with the continuity of life on earth requires place-specific practices. [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) has the role of developing ecological literacy (seeing patterns in nature).

# Benefits of an ALJ
Here's a brief overview of some of the main benefits accessible to Communities of Practice and related stakeholders by participating in the organising of an [action-learning journey](action-learning journey).

- Making visible the work happening on the ground
- Promoting collaboration
